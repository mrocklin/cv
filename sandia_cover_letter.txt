Hello, 

I am a current PhD student at the University of Chicago in computer science looking to relocate while still making progress on my thesis. I would welcome a full time position that has some synergy with my topic and allows me to participate in the authoring of academic papers.

I am interested in numerical methods for uncertainty quantification as well as high level/symbolic programming techniques to facilitate the writing of numerical code for heterogeneous (CPU/GPU) compute clusters. I also have some experience in complex networks. 

I hope that our interests, needs and abilities overlap well.  

Thank you for your consideration, 
-Matthew Rocklin
