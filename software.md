I produce high-level (symbolic) code to address low-level (numeric) concerns. I disseminate my research through publications and integration into the following open source software projects. 

-   [SymPy](http://sympy.org) -- *Symbolic mathematics in Python*: I am a core contributor to SymPy both in terms of number of commits (ranked #2/104 this year) and community involvement.  I manage the linear algebra, statistics, and rewrite rules modules.  I serve as a mentor in this organization for university and high school student programs.
-   [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) -- *A mathematics/array compiler*: My array primitives and scheduling work build on Theano. Contributions include MPI primitives, communication/computation overlap algorithms, asynchronous GPU communication, and interactions with SymPy.
-   [LogPy](http://github.com/logpy/logpy) --  *Logic Programming in Python* I
    created the LogPy project to serve as an algorithmic core for the projects above.
-   [APE](http://github.com/mrocklin/ape) -- Static scheduling of array operations onto heterogeneous hardware. Wraps an MPI layer around the Theano and SymPy Matrix Expressions projects. 

I have started many smaller academic projects which have eventually been rolled into one of the larger projects above. A more complete list is available at [http://matthewrocklin.com/code.html](http://matthewrocklin.com/code.html).
