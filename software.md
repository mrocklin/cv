I am an active contributor to libraries within Python's numeric computing
software ecosystem.  I am primarily known for my current work on Dask.

-  [Dask](https://dask.pydata.org) -- *Parallel computing with dynamic task
   scheduling*: Dask combines a high-speed computational task scheduler with
   algorithms for parallel arrays, dataframes, machine learning, etc..

Historically I have been involved in the following projects:

-   [SymPy](http://sympy.org) -- *Symbolic mathematics in Python*: Core
    contributor.  Maintains linear algebra, statistics, and logical
    assumptions.
-   [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) -- *Mathematical array
    compiler*: Supports concurrency, GPUs, scheduling, interactions with SymPy.
-   [Toolz](http://toolz.readthedocs.org/) -- *Functional toolbox*
