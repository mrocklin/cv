I produce high-level (symbolic) code to address low-level (numeric) concerns. I disseminate my research through publications and integration into the following open source software projects.

-   [SymPy](http://sympy.org) -- *Symbolic mathematics in Python*: Core
    contributor.  Maintains linear algebra, statistics, and logical
    assumptions.
-   [PyToolz](http://toolz.readthedocs.org/) -- *Functional standard library*:
    Creator.  Underscore.js for Python.
-   [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) -- *Mathematical array
    compiler*: Supports concurrency, GPUs, scheduling, interactions with SymPy.
-   [LogPy](http://github.com/logpy/logpy) --  *Logic Programming in Python*:
    Creator.  An implementation of miniKanren.

I have started many smaller academic projects which have eventually been rolled into one of the larger projects above. A more complete list is available at [http://matthewrocklin.com/code.html](http://matthewrocklin.com/code.html).
