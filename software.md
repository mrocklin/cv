I contribute to and maintain several libraries within Python's numeric
computing ecosystem, particularly around parallel and distributed computing.
I am primarily known for my current work on Dask.

-  [Dask](https://dask.pydata.org) -- *Parallel computing with dynamic task
   scheduling*: Dask combines a high-speed computational task scheduler with
   algorithms for parallel arrays, dataframes, machine learning, etc..

However in the maintenance of the Dask project I also end up acting as steward over a large part of the numerics ecosystem, dealing with libraries for communication, data access, and so on.

Historically I have been involved in the following open source projects:

-   [SymPy](http://sympy.org) -- *Symbolic mathematics in Python*:
-   [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) -- *Mathematical array compiler for deep learning*:
