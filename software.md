I coordinate and maintain several libraries within Python's numeric computing
ecosystem, particularly around efficient and scalable computing.

I am primarily known for my work on [Dask](https://dask.pydata.org), a library
for scalable computing with dynamic task scheduling.  Dask combines a
high-speed task scheduler with parallel algorithms to scale exisitng Python
libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and many others.

More generally though I work with other core developers within the ecosystem to
promote the general health and efficiency.  I contribute to and maintain dozens
of libraries.
